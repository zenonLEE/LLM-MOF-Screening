## ðŸ“‘ Abstract
We propose an intelligent evaluation framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and a multi-agent system to integrate semantic reasoning with numerical performance metrics for materials screening. Using MOFs for COâ‚‚ capture as a case study, the methodology combines adsorption simulations, process modeling, and energy-efficiency analysis with interpretable multi-agent evaluation, offering a scalable paradigm for intelligent materials discovery.
